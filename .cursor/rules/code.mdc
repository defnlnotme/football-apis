When implementing an extraction function:
- Make sure the prompt template (the on defined in globals) use {{}} if provide example json outputs (to avoid clashing with python format)
- Any html response should be cached (default 1 hour)
- --force-fetch should always be supported
- the output (extracted from the llm) must be saved to a json file in the data folder (adhering to the existing folder structure)

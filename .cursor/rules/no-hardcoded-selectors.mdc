MUST NOT hard code selectors (never).
MUST always use the LLM to find selectors.
anything that uses hard-coded parameters for filtering SHOULD be refactored to use the LLM.
Don't use any form of fallback mechanism when the LLM is not available or doesn't return the required data.
Don't over-complicate logic, if the LLM fails try with a more generic prompt, if the generic prompt fails raise an error.
Don't use heuristics, let the LLMs handle all the work.
